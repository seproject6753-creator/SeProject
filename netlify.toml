## Netlify build configuration for the React frontend
## Docs: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/

[build]
	# Run from the frontend directory and build there
	base = "frontend"
	command = "npm ci && npm run build"
	# When base is set, publish is relative to base
	publish = "build"

[build.environment]
	# Ensure a modern Node for CRA 5
	NODE_VERSION = "18"
	# Extra heap to avoid OOM on larger builds
	NODE_OPTIONS = "--max_old_space_size=4096"
	# Prevent CRA from failing the build on warnings in CI
	CI = "false"
	# (Optional) Completely disable CRA ESLint plugin during build so warnings never block deploy
	DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN = "true"
	# Set these in Netlify UI (recommended) or uncomment and commit to hardcode
	# REACT_APP_APILINK = "https://<your-render-app>.onrender.com/api"
	# REACT_APP_MEDIA_LINK = "https://<your-render-app>.onrender.com/media"
